# Composition

This page is part of the [web app README](README.md#composition). It gives
the props of `App`, the parts that a host gives to the workspace screen, and
the members UI of the org settings.

`App` in `src/App.tsx` takes three props:

| Prop         | What it gives                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `services`   | `AppServices` from `services.ts`: the API, the events, the clock, the storage  |
| `navigation` | The address bar: `browserNavigation(window)`, or `memoryNavigation` in tests   |
| `features`   | `WorkspaceFeatures` from `../shell/workspace/features.ts`: the workspace parts |

The workspace screen draws the frame, the header, the start steps, and the
states of the sandbox, with Restore on the bar of an archived workspace
until its last day. The real chat fills the
centre by default. The `tabs`, `transcript`, and `composer` slots replace it
with the shell's own chat column, as
[The chat of the workspace](../shell/workspace/README.md#the-chat-of-the-workspace)
says. Each feature is a function
of `WorkspaceContext`, which gives the org, the workspace, the viewer, the
sandbox state, whether the workspace is read-only, what a part shows while
the sandbox does not run, the layout, the address after the workspace, the
ordered event stream, the saved view of the kept chat, the events of the
tools, the Archive and Restore actions, and the one of them that runs. The
feature clients send through the
services of the org, from `useOrgServices`, whose client and fetch mark the
org on `org_suspended`. The shell gives
its own `files`, `tools`, `pullRequest`, and `owner` parts, as
[the workspace screen](../shell/workspace/README.md#the-files-part) says. A
part of the host takes the place of the shell's own part. A missing
feature leaves its place empty.

| Feature       | Place |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `tabs`        | The tabs of the shell's own chat column, in place of the chat |
| `transcript`  | The history of that column, before the start steps |
| `composer`    | The composer of that column while the sandbox runs or starts |
| `center`      | A part in place of the whole chat. Without it, the chat shows the file or diff tab of the address |
| `files`       | All files, Changes, and Checks. The shell gives its own |
| `tools`       | Terminal and Preview. The shell gives its own |
| `pullRequest` | The pull request bar, or the row on a phone. The shell gives its own |
| `owner`       | The owner picker that reassigns a workspace. The shell gives its own |

The org settings mount the members UI of `../members/`: `MembersSettings`
for the Members tab, Delete org in the General tab of an admin, the restore
page of a deleted org, and the read-only Repositories and Cloud computer
tabs of a member. The Cloud computer tab of a member gets the live builds,
log, and settings of `ComputerModel`. The Repositories tab of a member gets
the live builds of `OrgModel`, for its repository notice.
`useMembersApi(orgId)` in
`../shell/settings/members-api.ts` gives one members client for each org,
over the fetch of the org's client, so a refusal of a suspended org marks
the org. In a suspended org every person gets the read-only tabs, and the
restore page offers no Restore. A removal reads the list and the members
of the org again. Delete org and Restore give their answers to
`AppModel.putOrg`.
