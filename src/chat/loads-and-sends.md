# Loads, records, and sends

This guide belongs to [the chat](README.md). It gives the rules of the
history loads, the read-only chats, the order of the records, the sends,
and Stop.

## History loads

- The chat loads the history of each session that becomes the shown session,
  whatever changed the selection: a click, an action, or a record from the
  stream. One load runs at a time for each session, and a failed load waits
  for Try again or for the next selection.
- The status of the stored history comes from its load alone. A chat with
  content, such as live messages, a sent message, a running turn, or the
  start steps, keeps it and shows a failed load as a notice by the composer,
  with Try again. An empty chat shows the failure in place of the chat.
- The chat loads the session list and the view, then the full history of the
  shown session, then the workspace and the session list again. The stream
  starts after the history's `throughEventNumber`, so no change between the
  reads and the stream gets lost.
- The chat writes no browser storage. The drafts stay in memory, and the
  server keeps the open tabs through the view route. A kept controller
  lives only in the memory of its tab, so a reload or a new tab starts
  empty.

## Read-only chats

- A read-only workspace keeps its chat as it is, and the backend refuses
  its writes: an archived workspace, and one that the app shows read-only,
  such as in a suspended org. So its tabs change in the browser only. The
  session history opens the stored history of any session as a tab, and a
  tab closes with no write. A closed tab shows in the session history
  again, also the tab of a session that was open at the archive. The
  session records do not change, so a closed session stays closed. The
  controller's `select`, `requestClose`, and `reopen` take this path while
  the workspace is read-only, and the server path otherwise. The controller
  reads `readOnly` at each action, because a suspension can start during a
  visit, and it sends no other write then.
- A read-only chat shows no composer, no +, no tab menu, no Try again, no
  drag of a tab, and no answer to a Mac command. Its empty state names only
  the session history.

## Record order

- Each reply, read, and event with a session record, or with the workspace
  record and its start steps, carries the event number of its state. The
  newest number wins, whatever arrives first. So a Resume reply never
  hides a newer state from the stream, such as a failed start with its Try
  again. The steps after an action, such as a view save, the focus, or a
  free Resume button, still run when its reply is older. The header of
  [`state/session-records.ts`](state/session-records.ts) gives the pending
  edits of a rename or a model change.

## Sends and Stop

- A Stop request records the member who pressed Stop, and ends nothing. The
  turn ends when its end says stopped. A stop with no request names nobody:
  "The agent stopped".
- The composer reads Enter through `useSendKey` of
  `components/send-key.ts`, the one send key of every composer: the chat,
  and the page and the dialog of New workspace. On a computer, Enter sends
  and Shift+Enter adds a line, as
  [The send key](../../docs/protocol/create-a-workspace.md#the-send-key)
  says. In the phone layout, Enter adds a line.
- Send works while the sandbox is not ready: during the first start of a
  new workspace, after it failed, and during a resume. The workspace queues
  each message for the sandbox, as
  [Messages](../../docs/protocol/chat-and-events.md#messages) says.
- A failed first start shows the error state and a failed step of the
  create start, as `failedFirstStart` in
  [`../app/first-start.ts`](../app/first-start.ts) says. Its bar sits above
  the composer. A later error after a successful create,
  and a failed resume, keep the bar in place of the composer.
- The bar shows the message that the workspace saved for a failed start.
  The chat takes it from each read and Resume reply, and from each
  `workspace.updated` event. An event without an error keeps it, and null
  clears it.
- A send that the Worker refuses keeps its text, its files, and its message
  ID. The notice "Your message didn't send" shows the Worker's plain
  message.
