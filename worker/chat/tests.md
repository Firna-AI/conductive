# Chat backend tests

The `attachment-*.test.ts` files use local R2 and D1 through the internal storage boundary.
They cover exact bytes, ownership, first-message recovery, expiry races, copy proof, and Stop during a held transfer.
`attachment.test-support.ts` supplies the shared fixture and explicit fake preparation seams.
`integration/attachment-raw.test.ts` checks native fixed-length R2 writes, raw metadata and ownership, interrupted transfers, and desktop admission.
The HTTP and security raw-upload tests check shared route budgets and admission before body reads.

This guide belongs to the [chat backend](README.md). Run the tests from
the repository root:

```sh
npm run test -- worker/chat
npm run typecheck
```

- `createChatFixture` in `harness.test-support.ts` builds on
  `createHarness`. It adds an owner, a member, a workspace with a token,
  and a stored login for each agent.
- Its helpers send messages, open tabs, connect a `FakeRunner`, and
  restart `WorkspaceChat` on the same storage.
- `MemoryChatStorage` keeps the records in memory. Set `beforeCommit` to
  delay a commit and test a late commit.
- To test that a failed commit rolls back the whole receipt of an action,
  use `checkCommitBoundaries` in
  [`commit-boundary.test-support.ts`](commit-boundary.test-support.ts).
- Its key order and `startAfter` comparison use UTF-8 bytes, like real storage.
- Set `crashAfterCommit` to commit the next transaction, then throw once.
  The restart tests cover retry permission, report repairs, turn cleanup,
  and file assembly after a commit crash.
- Send and Retry can commit a changed login observation before acceptance.
  So an acceptance crash test first makes the stored `loginAvailable` current,
  then sets `crashAfterCommit`. The fault then hits the acceptance commit.
- `createRunnerLimitsFixture` in `runner-limits.test-support.ts` runs one
  `RunnerChannel` for the refusal, cap, and file part tests.
- `runner-repairs.test-support.ts` builds a full and an oversized report of
  each kind, and reads the requests and markers of the repair tests.
- `late-events.test.ts` and `never-started.test.ts` cover replay after a
  workspace stop and the queued-turn eligibility rules.
- `retry.test.ts`, `retry-queue.test.ts`, and `retry-crash.test.ts` cover
  the newest failed turn: stale tabs, refused ends, waiting work, rollback,
  and commit crashes. `retry.test-support.ts` sends retries and reads the
  session records.
- `session-logins.test.ts`, `linked-sessions.test.ts`, `linked-retry.test.ts`,
  and `legacy-sessions.test.ts` test starters, linked sessions, and old data.
  `login-observation.test.ts` tests that an observed change stays after a
  refused Send, and that a repeated message ID observes nothing.
  `linked-retry.test.ts` also restarts after a crash at the acceptance of a
  linked Retry. It checks each stored record, and a stale Retry gets 409.
- `login-reuse.test.ts` tests a starter who does not share the login.
  Another member gets an empty linked session, and the first session keeps
  `loginAvailable: true` with `loginShared: false`. A queued message of
  another member fails with the cause before the runner gets it, and its
  Retry opens a linked session.
- `login-availability.test.ts` tests the metadata path. One query serves one
  or four sessions and reads no credential. `loginShared` follows the share
  setting, and an open tab gets the changed value. Reads check no login and
  flush no runner. The list and a new tab still work with a damaged starter
  ciphertext. Closed sessions and archived workspaces stay unchanged.
  `login-queries.test-support.ts` records its D1 login queries.
- `turn-dispatch.test.ts` checks that a runner disconnect during the
  registration of a turn undoes that registration before any send.
- `device-cleanup.test.ts` checks Mac command cleanup after a refused turn
  end. It also checks that late ends preserve the next turn and its commands.
- `adapter.test.ts` runs `Workspace` in Miniflare, with SQLite storage,
  D1, and real WebSockets. `createAdapterRuntime` sets up that runtime.
- It closes every socket before Miniflare evicts the real object. Restart
  keeps SQLite history, queued messages, and the runner cursor. Event numbers
  continue. The resumed queued turn fails. Its message can retry after a
  second eviction.
- `createAdapterRuntime` can bundle another Durable Object entry for
  another workspace ID. The [GitHub store tests](../github/README.md#verification)
  use it to run `WorkspaceChat` with the GitHub state on SQLite.
- The tests in `integration/` run the production Worker entry in
  Miniflare. They check the forwarding, the runner socket, the workspace
  lifecycle, and the app API. `integration/run-browser-harness.mjs` serves
  a production app build through that entry.
  [Outer Worker tests](integration/outer-worker-tests.md) describes them.
- `first-message.test.ts` checks that a sender who is not the assigned
  sender of a first message gets a refusal, and that no session is stored.
- `workspace-summary.test.ts` checks the stored summary: the event cursor,
  the visible output, and the dispatched work. Queued input and metadata
  are not output.
