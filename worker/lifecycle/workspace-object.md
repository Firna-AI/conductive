# Workspace Durable Object

This page belongs to the [workspace lifecycle README](README.md). It
describes the Durable Object of each workspace and of each image
coordinator: its names, its lifecycle steps, its alarm, its start logs,
its event socket, and the publication of its events.

`Workspace` in [`worker/workspace.ts`](../workspace.ts) is the Durable
Object class of the `WORKSPACES` binding. [`runtime.ts`](runtime.ts) gets
each object by name, with the Western Europe location hint. Each name has
one role:

- The workspace ID names the workspace object of one workspace.
- `org-image:<orgId>` names the image coordinator of one org.

Its public methods are internal RPC, not HTTP routes. This folder uses the
`WorkspaceLifecycleEndpoint` interface of
[`workspace-runtime.ts`](workspace-runtime.ts). Inside the object,
`createWorkspaceIntegration` in
[`workspace-integration.ts`](../chat/workspace-integration.ts) calls these
lifecycle steps from the chat hooks, as
[The workspace lifecycle](../chat/integration/README.md#the-workspace-lifecycle)
says:

- `registerLifecycleTurn` records the trusted sender of a turn before the
  turn goes out. `finishLifecycleTurn`, or a report that the turn ended,
  removes it.
- `reportRunnerLifecycle` takes each runner event that ordered runner
  ingestion accepts. `runnerLifecycleDisconnected` takes a disconnect.
- `acknowledgeLifecycleFirstMessage` clears the pending first message of
  the create. The admission keeps its own copy for repeats.
- `openLifecycleTab` and `closeLifecycleTab` keep the IDs of the open tabs.
  The open route also calls `openLifecycleTab`.

The `alarm` of the class serves both roles. For an image coordinator, it
advances the running build or refresh by one step, or starts the daily
refresh. For a workspace object, it:

- runs the queued start of a create or a resume, one phase at a time
- stops the sandbox after 30 minutes without activity or a running turn
- extends the Boat auto-stop deadline while a turn runs, and applies the
  state in that reply even when the saved runner flag says connected
- reads the sandbox state from Boat while the runner is not connected
- runs the disk retention restart 13 days after each confirmed stop
- retries the sandbox delete of a failed create

The deadline and stop actions use the sandbox state in each Boat reply.
When Boat refuses an action, they read the sandbox state once. The
[Boat update reference](https://docs.boat.dev/api/reference/sandboxes/update-sandbox)
does not promise a refusal for an archived sandbox, so the code handles a
reply and a refusal. A confirmed stop or a Boat `error` state clears all
running sessions and turn records. A Boat `error` state sets the workspace
error state, with no resume and no delete. A stop reply that still shows an
active sandbox keeps the workspace state and schedules another alarm.

The object encrypts the env values and output chunks of a start. To release
a log, it joins all stdout parts, then all stderr parts, and masks the
joined text with the saved env values. So a value that crosses the stdout
and stderr boundary stays hidden. Only `MaskedStartLog.mask` can create a
`MaskedStartLog`, because the constructor is private. Internal RPC carries
only encrypted log data, and the caller decrypts and masks it again.
Browser responses keep the plain string log of the shared contract.

The `fetch` of the class opens the workspace event socket at
`workspaceEventsPath` of `src/shared/events.ts`. Forward the browser's
upgrade request without changes, because the object runs the browser gate
itself. The socket sends the stored history first, then each new event.
After a failed create removes its records, `failedCreationEvents` in
[`failed-creation-events.ts`](failed-creation-events.ts) serves that path
only to the sender of the first message, after the browser gate. It sends
the stored public history once, with the `message.accepted` event of the
first message, and then closes. The browser does not restore the composer
from it yet. The owner of `src/app/` and `src/shell/` adds that recovery.

`WorkspaceEventJournal` in [`durable-journal.ts`](durable-journal.ts) keeps
ordered lifecycle publication and suppresses unchanged updates. The
production `Workspace` sends each `workspace.updated` and `start.updated`
event to `WorkspaceChat`, through `commitWorkspaceEvent` or the `publish`
argument of a chat hook. Chat stores and numbers the only workspace event
history, with chat and lifecycle events.
