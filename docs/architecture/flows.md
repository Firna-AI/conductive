# Flows

Each flow uses the components and the terms of the
[architecture doc](../architecture.md). A decision number names a dated
record, as [Decision numbers](../architecture.md#decision-numbers) says.

## Create a workspace

1. The user sends the first message of a new workspace. The Worker records
   the workspace, and its Durable Object keeps the message.
2. With the Boat key, the Worker asks Boat for a sandbox from the newest
   good org image of the org. The sandbox gets the workspace token and the
   org's env vars, but no agent login.
3. The Durable Object pushes each start step to the open tabs.
4. The agent runner starts and connects to the Durable Object. The Durable
   Object sends it the waiting message.

## Chat

1. A tab sends a message to the Worker. The Durable Object forwards it to
   the agent runner, with the agent login of the starter of its session.
2. The runner gives it to the agent through the SDK. It numbers each agent
   event and sends it to the Durable Object.
3. The Durable Object stores each event, confirms it to the runner, and
   pushes it to every open tab of the workspace.

## Terminal, previews, and desktop

- The terminal socket goes from the browser to the Worker on
  `app.conductive.build`. The Worker connects it to the private terminal
  port.
- A preview frame loads its preview hostname. The Worker proxies the
  request to the private preview relay of the sandbox. The relay forwards
  it to the previewed server with its local address as `Host`.
- The Worker asks Boat for a short-lived desktop URL, and the browser
  shows Boat's desktop stream.

## GitHub events

- GitHub sends pull request, check, status, and push webhooks. The Worker
  routes each event to the workspace of its branch.
- A push to the default branch of a chosen repository can also start a
  refresh of the org image.

## Stops

- The Durable Object stops a sandbox when the stop rule of
  [Workspaces and sandboxes](../protocol/workspaces-and-sandboxes.md#stop-and-resume)
  says so.
- Near day 14 of a stop, the app starts the sandbox briefly and stops it
  again, so that Boat keeps its disk (decision 43).
