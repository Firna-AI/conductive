# Agents and sessions

This doc holds the requirements and the decisions in force for the agents
and the sessions of a workspace. It covers the agents and their logins,
the names of the agents in the product, the sessions, and the names of
workspaces and sessions. It belongs to
[Chat and events](chat-and-events.md). The terms are those of the
[architecture doc](../architecture.md#terms). A decision number names a
dated record, as [Decision numbers](../architecture.md#decision-numbers)
says.

## Agents

- The app offers two agents for now: Claude and Codex (decision 19).
- The agents run in the agent runner, our program in each sandbox, through
  the agent SDKs (decision 36).
- Boat's built-in agents were rejected. The user found them too expensive,
  and their events reach the app only by polling.
- An agent loop in the Worker was rejected, because the agents need the
  files and the tools of the sandbox. Anthropic's Managed Agents were
  rejected, because they cover only Claude.
- Claude runs through the Claude Agent SDK. Codex runs through the Codex
  SDK when that SDK can interrupt a turn and stream partial text. Otherwise
  Codex runs through the Codex App Server.
- Every member of the org can send messages in each of its workspaces.
- Each session runs on the agent login of its starter, the member who
  started the session (decision 105). The starter of a session never
  changes, so a session never moves to the login of another member.
- A member starts a session in one of these ways:
  - with "+"
  - with a model of the other agent
  - with the first message of a new workspace
  - with a message that starts a new session, as
    [Messages](chat-and-events.md#messages) says
- The session record names its starter in `startedBy`. A session without a
  known starter has no login that can be used.
- While the starter shares the login, the messages of the other members
  run on it too. So the other members spend the login of the starter
  (decision 116).
- Reason: each change of login rewrites the prompt cache of the
  conversation. A login for each sender was rejected for that reason.
- The login of the workspace owner for all sessions was rejected. Reason:
  each member who starts a session spends their own login.
- [Access and security](access-and-security.md#agent-logins-in-a-sandbox)
  states how a login reaches the sandbox, its share setting, and its risk.
- A session keeps its memory across a stop and a resume of the sandbox.

## Names in the product

- User-facing text calls the agents "agents powered by Claude and Codex".
- User-facing text never uses "Claude Code" as a name of the product or of
  its features. Reason: Anthropic forbids that use for a product that builds
  on its Agent SDK.
- The model picker names the model and the effort, such as "Opus 5.5 Max".
  It does not show the words Claude or Codex.
- The app marks each agent with a small mark of its own. It shows no brand
  logo of an agent.

## Sessions

- A workspace holds one or more sessions. Each session is a closable tab in
  the centre column, beside the open files and diffs (decision 19).
- "+" starts a new session on the same branch and in the same sandbox.
- The open session tabs show in the order of creation. A new session
  opens as the last tab (decision 77).
- The tab of a session shows the title of the session.
- A new session has no title, and its tab shows "Untitled".
  [Workspace and session names](#workspace-and-session-names) says when
  the app gives it a title.
- When the workspace takes a title as its name, as
  [Messages](chat-and-events.md#messages) says, the first session takes the
  title too (decision 181).
- Each other session takes its title from the first message with text that
  the workspace accepts in that session (decision 181). The title is the
  first line with text of that message.
- A message with no text, such as a message with only a screenshot, gives
  no title.
- In a title from a message, each run of spaces becomes one space. The app
  removes one final full stop, but it keeps an ellipsis.
- A title from a message holds at most 60 characters. The limit counts
  Unicode code points. The app cuts a longer line after its last whole
  word that fits the limit. When the first word does not fit, the app cuts
  the line at the limit.
- The user can rename a session.
- Reason: the first session does the task of the workspace, and each other
  session does the task of its own first message. A title request for each
  session was rejected, because the first message names that task with no
  model call.
- Each session has its own model picker.
- When one tab sends two edits of the same field of a session, the edit
  that the server commits last wins (decision 142).
- Closing the tab of a session without a running turn moves the session to
  the session history (decision 31).
- Closing the tab of a session whose turn runs asks first. After the
  confirm, the app stops the turn and moves the session to the history.
- Reason: no agent runs where the user cannot see it, and no history gets
  lost. A close that only hides a running session was rejected for the
  first reason. A close that deletes the history was rejected for the
  second.
- The history lists the closed sessions, the last closed first. Each entry
  shows the agent of its last message, the title, and the time since it
  closed.
- An entry of the history reopens its session as a tab, with its chat.

## Workspace and session names

- In this section, a name is the name of a workspace or the title of a
  session.
- A new workspace has no name (decision 182). Each new session has no name
  either (decision 185).
- The app shows "Untitled" in place of a missing name.
- In the workspace record, a missing name is null in `name`. In the session
  record, a missing name is null in `title`.
- An automatic name is a name that the app gives on its own. These names
  are automatic:
  - the title of a workspace, as [Messages](chat-and-events.md#messages) says
  - a workspace name that the agent runner reports, as
    [Lost workspace updates](agent-runner.md#lost-workspace-updates) says
  - the title that a session takes, as [Sessions](#sessions) says
- The app gives an automatic name only to a workspace or a session that has
  no name (decision 182). So no automatic name replaces a name that a
  member or the app gave.
- The app gives no automatic name in an archived workspace, or in a
  workspace of a deleted org.
- Reason: a missing name shows that no one named the workspace or the
  session yet. A text comparison with "New session" or the city name of
  the branch was rejected. A member can type the same text and then lose
  that name.
- Reason: an archived workspace shows its chat read-only (decision 16).
