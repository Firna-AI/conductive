# Chat and events

This doc holds the requirements and the decisions in force for the chat of
a workspace. It covers the sessions, the messages, the agent runner in the
sandbox, and the events that reach the browser. The terms are those of the
[architecture doc](../architecture.md#terms). A decision number names a
dated record, as [Decision numbers](../architecture.md#decision-numbers)
says.

These docs belong to this doc:

- [Messages and attachments](messages-and-attachments.md): the composer,
  the messages and turns of a session, and the files of a message.
- [The agent runner](agent-runner.md): the runner in the sandbox, its
  events and their limits, and lost workspace updates.

## Agents

- The app offers two agents for now: Claude and Codex (decision 19).
- The agents run in the agent runner, our program in each sandbox, through
  the agent SDKs (decision 36).
- Boat's built-in agents were rejected. The user found them too expensive,
  and their events reach the app only by polling.
- An agent loop in the Worker was rejected, because the agents need the
  files and the tools of the sandbox. Anthropic's Managed Agents were
  rejected, because they cover only Claude.
- Claude runs through the Claude Agent SDK. Codex runs through the Codex
  SDK when that SDK can interrupt a turn and stream partial text. Otherwise
  Codex runs through the Codex App Server.
- Every member of the org can send messages in each of its workspaces.
- Each session runs on the agent login of its starter, the member who
  started the session (decision 105). The starter of a session never
  changes, so a session never moves to the login of another member.
- A member starts a session in one of these ways:
  - with "+"
  - with a model of the other agent
  - with the first message of a new workspace
  - with a message that starts a new session, as [Messages](messages-and-attachments.md#messages) says
- The session record names its starter in `startedBy`. A session without a
  known starter has no login that can be used.
- While the starter shares the login, the messages of the other members
  run on it too. So the other members spend the login of the starter
  (decision 116).
- Reason: each change of login rewrites the prompt cache of the
  conversation. A login for each sender was rejected for that reason.
- The login of the workspace owner for all sessions was rejected. Reason:
  each member who starts a session spends their own login.
- [Access and security](isolation.md#agent-logins-in-a-sandbox)
  states how a login reaches the sandbox, its share setting, and its risk.
- A session keeps its memory across a stop and a resume of the sandbox.

## Names in the product

- User-facing text calls the agents "agents powered by Claude and Codex".
- User-facing text never uses "Claude Code" as a name of the product or of
  its features. Reason: Anthropic forbids that use for a product that builds
  on its Agent SDK.
- The model picker names the model and the effort, such as "Opus 5.5 Max".
  It does not show the words Claude or Codex.
- The app marks each agent with a small mark of its own. It shows no brand
  logo of an agent.

## Sessions

- A workspace holds one or more sessions. Each session is a closable tab in
  the centre column, beside the open files and diffs (decision 19).
- "+" starts a new session on the same branch and in the same sandbox.
- The open session tabs show in the order of creation. A new session
  opens as the last tab (decision 77).
- The user can rename a session.
- Each session has its own model picker.
- When one tab sends two edits of the same field of a session, the edit
  that the server commits last wins (decision 142).
- Closing the tab of a session without a running turn moves the session to
  the session history (decision 31).
- Closing the tab of a session whose turn runs asks first. After the
  confirm, the app stops the turn and moves the session to the history.
- Reason: no agent runs where the user cannot see it, and no history gets
  lost. A close that only hides a running session was rejected for the
  first reason. A close that deletes the history was rejected for the
  second.
- The history lists the closed sessions, the last closed first. Each entry
  shows the agent of its last message, the title, and the time since it
  closed.
- An entry of the history reopens its session as a tab, with its chat.

## What the chat shows

- The chat history shows also while the sandbox is stopped or starting.
- An archived workspace shows its chat read-only (decision 16).
- The chat shows a starting state until the agent runner reports that the
  agent can take a message.
- While the agent thinks and has no text yet, the chat shows a thinking
  state.
- Agent text reaches the open tabs while the agent writes it, not only at
  the end of the turn.
- While a turn runs, the chat shows the time since the turn started, and
  Stop sits beside Send.
- A finished turn ends with its duration and the files that it changed.
- When the runner cannot tell which files a turn changed, its end shows
  "Changed files unavailable" in place of the files (decision 109). The
  turn still shows as finished or stopped, not as failed.
- The chat never says that such a turn changed no files.
- Reason: the agent finished its work, and only the list of its files is
  missing. An empty list was rejected, because it says that the turn
  changed no files. A failed turn was rejected, because it shows a failure
  for finished work.
- A tool detail and a turn file list give a count of data that their limits omit.
- A refused runner event shows one chat line that names the lost data,
  unless it is a [lost workspace update](agent-runner.md#lost-workspace-updates).
- The chat hides the messages that the SDK adds on its own, such as
  "[Request interrupted by user]".
- Each result of the agent shows with the messages that it answers. One
  result can answer more than one message.

## Events

- The browser gets chat events only in the app's own event type. No SDK
  event type and no provider event type reaches the browser.
- Reason: one event type serves both agents, and the web app needs no
  change when an SDK changes its events.
- Every open tab of a workspace gets the same events in the same order.
- A tab that opens gets the stored history first, then the live events.
- The Durable Object of the workspace stores every event, so the chat
  survives a stop of the sandbox.
- A tab keeps the chat of each workspace that it showed in memory. A
  return to that workspace shows the chat at once, then gets only the new
  events (decision 87).
- A reload or a new tab starts empty. No chat stays on the disk of the
  device.
- A cache on the disk was rejected, because the chat, with its code and
  any secret that an agent printed, would stay on the device.

## The agent runner

- [The agent runner](agent-runner.md#the-agent-runner) states the
  connection of the runner, its events and their limits, and its turns.
